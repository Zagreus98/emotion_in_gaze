This code implements a trainer for a multi-task network which performs gaze estimation
and emotion classification. It was developed for my Dissertation project.

The hyperparams for an experiment are available and can be modified using the config from `configs/efficientnet_train.yaml`.
After the desired params are set, one has to run script `python tools/train.py`.
